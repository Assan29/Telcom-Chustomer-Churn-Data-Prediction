## BUSSINESS UNDERSTATING OF TELCO CUSTOMER CHURN
Telco customer churn data is a dataset that contains information about customers who have left a telecom company. The dataset includes information about the customers who left within the last month, and it provides details about the services they used, such as phone, multiple lines, and internet services

The business understanding of telco customer churn data is to determine if a customer from a particular telecom industry will leave that telecom service or not. This is done by performing a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) process to draw insights from data visualization and analysis so that we could get the factors which will affect the output i.e. churn of the customer

Telecom companies around the world are implementing a comprehensive, analytics-based approach to base management to reduce their churn by as much as 15%. The companies that excel at reducing churn through analytics find that four best practices separate them from average performers: developing a comprehensive view of the customer and linking that view directly to results, using cutting-edge analytical techniques, developing predictive models, and using machine learning algorithms.

In summary, telco customer churn data is an important dataset for telecom companies to analyze in order to reduce their churn rate. By using advanced analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms, telecom companies can develop predictive models that help them identify customers who are most likely to leave their service and take proactive measures to retain them.
